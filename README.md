# Pre-work - TIP ME

TIP ME is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Jaspreet Singh

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

-Make it so the user can adjust the tip percentage with the keypad instead of just having access to those default tip percentages.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was having trouble making all of the digits of the totals appear the first time I ran the build. I was able to fix this by adjusting the width of the label.
